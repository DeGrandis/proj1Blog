This project was pretty neat.  My experience with this project was pretty straightforward.  I read the spec, decided which language I wanted to use, and then started researching that language.  I went with Kotlin because I don't own an Apple machine.  At first I thought kotlin was pretty extra, and not in a good way.  But while troubleshooting and working though the problem, I learned about how different things can be if you just think about them from a new perspective.  In my case, I saw that some of the things I wanted to do in kotlin were very intuitive and simple compared to java.  For instance, I enjoyed how the switch case turned into a when case.  This is much more intuitive and makes most sense for returning multiple different values, without being as verbose as a switch statement.  Finally, as my partner stated, it was pretty neat to write code that utilized emojis.

For doing this project. I found programming is actually really fun! Before I got in touch with this project, I never knew I can actually write code with emojis. Also, using a programming language to transfer natural language to another  programming language is cool. In the past, I thought programming languages are independence to each other and they would never correspond to each other but actually it would. Don't always treat programming language a tool to solve real-life problems. They sometimes can be a bridge to transfer stuffs on each side.
