For doing this project. I found programming is actually really fun! Before I got in touch with this project, I never knew I can actually write code with emojis. Also, using a programming language to transfer natural language to another  programming language is cool. In the past, I thought programming languages are independence to each other and they would never correspond to each other but actually it would. Don't always treat programming language a tool to solve real-life problems. They sometimes can be a bridge to transfer stuffs on each side.
